Tutorial 3 due tonight
Lab today
Exam 1: Wednesday, February 11 during lab time
No project this week

--> next week will have a normal structure
(background reading, tutorial, 2 labs, project)

/////////////////////////

Exam 1:
- mix of multiple choice and open-ended
- closed notes/computers, written exam 

Topics:
- structure of a Java program file
- printing
- variables and operations
- user input (String, int, double)
- conditional statements
- loops (including nested loops)

See practice exam.
    (work #3-4)


Common multiple choice problem:
- Figuring out the value of variables after pieces of code


////////////////

double val;

<-- what value does val have now?

no value

/////////////////

int total = 1;
for (int i = 2; i < 7; i+=2) {
    total += i;
}

<-- what value does i have? 


<-- what value does total have? 

(skipped - this would be a good practice problem)

//////////////////

int x = 4;
int y = 2;
while (x < 20) {
    x = x + y;
    y = y + 5;
}

--> what values do x and y have here?

(skipped - this would be a good practice problem)


///////////////////

What does "iteration" mean? one time through the loop
How many iterations of the while loop?
    (how many times through it went)

///////////////////

Nested loops.

some outer loop {
    some inner loop {

    }
}


What order do things happen?

/////////////////////

Example, print this pattern:

5
4 5
3 4 5
2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5

outer loop through rows
    inner loop through columns/elements on current row

what's different on each? start number
for each number: 

outer loop through starting numbers

for (int i = 5; i >= 1; i--) {
    //i is the starting number
    for (int j = i; j <= 5; j++) {
        System.out.print(j + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}

/////////////////////

Work #5 on practice exam

/////////////////////

Example: make a repeatable dice game with a max score

(skipped - this would be a good practice problem)
