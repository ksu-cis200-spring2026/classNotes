What arrays to store?

Calculating dates

month, day, year as integers

create a String[] for the dates in that ranges
    size is the same as the time span

make a for loop to step through the dates you need to calculate
    put month/day/year in my dates array
        month + "/" + day + "/" + year
    are you on the last day in december (check days in month)
        day = 1
        month = 1
        year++ 
    are you on the last day in another month (check days in month)
        day = 1
        month++
    otherwise, day++

have an array for the low temperatures

have an array for the high temperatures

Temperature ranges?

Two-dimensional arrays (Grid.java).




///////////////////////////

Lab. 

1) Create a 2D array with values 1, 2, ... that can be "read" 
like a book

int cur = 1; //before loops

just increase by 1 each time


2) repeatedly left-shift each row until user wants to stop


How to left-shift?
    {1,2,3,4} becomes?
    (in general) update each position to be...?

What kind of loops are needed?

outer loop for the menu
    if they do want to left-shift
        loop through rows (i)
            save in a temp variable the first value on that row
            loop through all but the last column (j)
                set each element to the one next to it
            put my temp variable in the last column on that row


Reminder: switching between types of input
