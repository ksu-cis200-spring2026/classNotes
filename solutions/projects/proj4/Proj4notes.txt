1. Error condition test cases.
    - Date: 11/31/25 (tests an out of bound day). Program prints that 31 is an invalid day and exits.
    - Date: 13/22/25 (tests an out of bound month). Program prints that 13 is an invalid month and exits.
    - Date: 1/1/-4 (tests an out of bound year). Program prints that -4 is an invalid year and exits.
    - Time span: 0. Program prints that 0 is an invalid time span and exits.

2. Date/time span test cases.
    - Date: 12/25/25, time span: 7. (Tests a time span that ends at the end of a month).
        Program outputs dates from 12/25/25 to 12/31/25.
    - Date: 12/31/25, time span: 2. (Tests a time span that starts at the end of a year and ends at the 
        beginning of a year). Program outputs dates from 12/31/25 to 1/1/26.
    - Date: 2/27/24, time span: 34. (Tests a time span that includes the end of February in a leap year.)
        Program outputs dates from 2/27/24 to 3/1/24 (which includes 2/29/24)

3. Temperature swing test cases.
    - Day 1: (high 45, low 22), Day 2: (high 37, low 12). Tests the edge case of just two dates.
        Program outputs a 33 degree swing (45 to 12).
    - Day 1: (high 42, low 17), Day 2: (high 50, low 40), Day 3: (high 55, low 32)
        Tests the case where the swing is a low followed by a high.
        Program outputs a 33 degree swing (17 to 50). 
    - Day 1: (high 53, low 17), Day 2: (high 54, low 40), Day 3: (high 32, low 13), Day 4: (high 53, low 42)
        Tests the case where the swing is a high followed by a low.
        Program outputs a 41 degree swing (54 to 13)

4. Error and fix.
    Program initially printed the dates out of order for some temperature swings (i.e., it might have printed
        that the biggest swing was from 10 degrees on 1/2/26 to 40 degrees on 1/1/26). This was fixed by comparing the
        positions of the dates involved in the low/high portions of the swing and making sure to print the dates in ascending
        order.
