1) Example: num = 18

Prints "18 = "

Before loop:
origNum = 18
prime = true
factor = 2
mostFactor = 0
mostCount = 1
curCount = 0

Check loop condition: factor <= num (2 <= 18) is true
    Check if condition: num % factor (18 % 2) == 0 is true
        Print factor (2)
        prime = false
        num /= factor makes num = 9

        num is not 1, so print *
        curCount++ makes curCount = 1

Check loop condition: factor <= num (2 <= 9) is true
    Check if condition: num % factor (9 % 2) == 0 is false, so enter else
    Check inner if condition: curCount > mostCount (1 >= 0) is true
        mostFactor = factor (2)
        mostCount = curCount (1)
    curCount = 0
    factor++ makes factor = 3

 Check loop condition: factor <= num (3 <= 9) is true
    Check if condition: num % factor (9 % 3) == 0 is true
        Print factor (3)
        prime = false
        num /= factor makes num = 3

        num is not 1, so print *
        curCount++ makes curCount = 1   

 Check loop condition: factor <= num (3 <= 3) is true
    Check if condition: num % factor (3 % 3) == 0 is true
        Print factor (3)
        prime = false
        num /= factor makes num = 1

        num is 1, so don't print *
        curCount++ makes curCount = 2   

 Check loop condition: factor <= num (3 <= 1) is false, so exit loop

Check if condition: curCount > mostCount (2 > 1) is true
    mostFactor = factor (3)
    mostCount = curCount (2)

Prime is false, so enters else:
    Prints newlines
    Prints most common factor of origNum (18) is mostFactor (3), which occurred curCount (2) times


2) Good test cases (plus show output on those cases):
    a) Negative or 0 - should print an error instead of trying to factor
        Enter -4, prints: 
            Error: input must be positive

    b) A prime number (like 7)
        Enter 7, prints:
            7 = 7
            7 is prime

    c) An edge case (like 1) - should print that 1 is not prime or composite
        Enter 1, prints:
            1 is neither prime nor composite

    d) A number with just one factor (like 64)
        Enter 64, prints:
            64 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2
            Most common factor of 64 is 2, which occurred 6 times

    e) A number with all unique factors (like 30)
        Enter 30, prints:
            30 = 2 * 3 * 5
            Most common factor of 30 is 2, which occurred 1 time


3) An error and how to fix it (could be anything):
Error: the most frequent factor was incorrect in cases where the most frequent factor was also the last factor
Fix: added a last check after the loop to see if the most recent factor was also the most frequent
