Exam 1 is Thursday, February 12


Project 3 due Friday. Check file/folder names - 
    will be a deduction for naming.

Prime factorization of 12?

12 = 2*2*3


Prime factorization of 7?

7 = 7


Finding prime factorization:

num: user input
factor: start at 2
left: num

while(condition):
    if factor divides in evenly to left (using %):
        print factor
        divide factor out of left (update left)
    else:
        factor++


How to tell if prime? last factor checked would be 
    original input. Also would have just printed one factor.


How to find most frequent factor?

finding the biggest value of a collection of numbers

keep track of the biggest you've seen so far 

loop through the collection
    see if current item > biggest
        biggest = item




Update:

num: user input
factor: start at 2
left: num
mostFreqFactor: dummy (0)
freqFactorCount: dumy (0)
curFactorCount: 0

while(condition):
    if factor divides in evenly to left (using %):
        print factor
        divide factor out of left (update left)
        increase current factor count
    else:
        see if curFactorCount > freqFactorCount:
            freqFactorCount = curFactorCount
            mostFreqFactor = factor
        reset curFactorCount to 0
        factor++




/////////////////////////

Do-while loops.

do {
    statements
} while (condition);


How are they different from while loops?

checks condition at end
always execute at least once 

Best situations to use a do-while?


////////////////////////////

break - exits the loop

//What does this do?

int x = 0;
int y = 0;
do {
    x++;
    if (x == 1) {
        break;
    }
    y+=x;
} while (x < 5);
System.out.println(y);

immediately leaves loop, y is 0


///////////////////////////

continue - moves to the next iteration as long
    as condition is still true


//What does this do?

int x = 0;
int y = 0;
do {
    x++;
    if (x == 1) {
        continue;
    }
    y+=x;
} while (x < 5);
System.out.println(y);

will do the sum of 2+3+4+5

////////////////////////////

Random numbers.

import?

import java.util.*;

create random number generator?

Random r = new Random();



generate random number 0-4?

int val = r.nextInt(5);



///////////////////

Example: have user guess a random number


///////////////////

Look at lab. 
- rolling a dice?
- making it pause before dice rolls?

To get program to pause after prompt:
s.nextLine();
