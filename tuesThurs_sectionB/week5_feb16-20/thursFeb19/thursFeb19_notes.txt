Calculating dates

    //assuming "start" is the user input for the starting date
    //like "12/28/25"
    String[] pieces = start.split("/");
    int[] startDate = new int[pieces.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < pieces.length; i++) {
        startDate[i] = Integer.parseInt(pieces[i]);
    }
    //startDate is a size 3 array
    //startDate[0] is month, startDate[1] is the day, startDate[2] is the year

    int[] days = {31,28,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31};


Store dates in array (recommend string array)
    - size is the timespan

month = startDate[0]
day = startDate[1]
year = startDate[2] 

loop to generate each new date (for loop recommended)
    create next date month + "/" + day + "/" + year, put in the current array location
    
    am I on the last day in the year? (check month is 12, days[month-1] == day)
        day = 1
        month = 1
        year++
    am I on the last day of the month?
    otherwise?
        day++





Temperature arrays?

/////////////////////////////

Two-dimensional arrays (Grid.java).




///////////////////////////

Lab. 

1) Create a 2D array with values 1, 2, ... that can be "read" 
like a book

2) repeatedly left-shift each row until user wants to stop


How to left-shift?
    {1,2,3,4} becomes?
    (in general) update each position to be...?

What kind of loops are needed?

outer loop: menu loop  
    do they want to left shift?
        loop through rows with i(to shift each one)
            use a temp variable to save out the first element on that row
            loop through all but the last column with j 
                make current element = next element
            now put your temp variable in the last element on that row



Reminder: switching between types of input

After getting integer input:
    s.nextLine();
